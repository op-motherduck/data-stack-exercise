# =============================================================================
# DBT PROJECT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Purpose: Configures the dbt (data build tool) project for data transformations:
#   - Defines project name, version, and profile settings
#   - Specifies file paths for models, analyses, tests, and macros
#   - Configures model materialization strategies (views, tables)
#   - Sets up clean targets and package management
#   - Establishes project structure for data transformation workflows
# 
# This file is the main configuration for the dbt data transformation
# pipeline that processes raw data into analytics-ready models.
# =============================================================================

# Name your project! Project names should contain only lowercase characters
# and underscores. A good package name should reflect your organization's
# name or the intended use of these models
name: 'datastack_transform'
version: '1.0.0'

# This setting configures which "profile" dbt uses for this project.
profile: 'datastack_transform'

# These configurations specify where dbt should look for different types of files.
# The `model-paths` config, for example, states that models in this project can be
# found in the "models/" directory. You probably won't need to change these!
model-paths: ["models"]
analysis-paths: ["analyses"]
test-paths: ["tests"]
seed-paths: ["seeds"]
macro-paths: ["macros"]
snapshot-paths: ["snapshots"]

clean-targets:         # directories to be removed by `dbt clean`
  - "target"
  - "dbt_packages"


# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
